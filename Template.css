/* 
------Recommended element selectors to use------

Header - All headers on every page using the CSS file
should have the same styling. Background-image and styling, 
text styling, border styling, and if possible, animation(s) 
are recommended.

Body - All bodies should have the same styling. So that way, as
an example, if I add multiple text tags on the website, they 
would all fit my ideal theme for the website without needing to
tweak each tag's class individually. Unless I want separate styling
for the specific tag.

------Recommended attributes to use for styling------

--Dividers--

Padding - Controls the amount of space surrounding a component.
Height - Controls the vertical space surrounding a component.
Width - Controls the horizontal space surrounding a component.
Block-Size - Another good style to change the component's surrounding size.
--Text/Font--

Text-Align - Controls at what position of a whole line the text is at.
Text-Shadow - Adds a shadow to the font.
Font-Family - Changes font style.


--Background--

Background-Image - Sets the background image. A must for the body, optional for text.
Background-Repeat - Always select "no-repeat."
Background-Size - Always select "cover."

--Border--

Border-Image - Sets the border image. Would be nice to include around text or dividers.
